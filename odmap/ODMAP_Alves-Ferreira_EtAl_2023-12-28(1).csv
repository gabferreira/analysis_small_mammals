"Overview","Hypotheses","Hypotheses","We used Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) through an ensemble approach to assess the potential distribution of 44 species of small mammals (Rodentia and Marsupialia) using baseline (1970-2000) and future (2050 and 2070) climate scenarios. We evaluate if protected areas and forest remnants in the Atlantic Forest of South America (AF) will ensure the taxonomic diversity (TD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of non-volant small mammals under scenarios of future climate change"
"Overview","Assumptions","Model assumptions","• Occurrence records are accurate and representative.
• Species are at equilibrium with their environment.
• The niche is preserved over time.
• Models do not consider potential for adaptation to climate change.
• Species have unlimited dispersal capacity."

"Overview","Algorithms","Model averaging","We created ensemble models with “weighted averages” through  the TSS value (Ribeiro-Souza et al., 2022) using the R package sdm (Naimi and Araújo, 2016)."
"Overview","Workflow","Model workflow","We used the algorithms MARS, Support Vector Machines - SVM, MaxEnt, Random forest, MaxLike, and Generalized Linear Models - GLM with default parameters to build the ENMs using the R packages dismo (Hijmans et al., 2011) and sdm (Naimi and Araújo 2016). We calibrated and evaluated the models using the R packages dplyr (Wickham et al., 2023), raster (Hijmans and Etten, 2012) and dismo (Hijmans et al., 2011). First, we divided the occurrence records for test (30%) and training (70%) (Ribeiro-Souza et al., 2022) 20 times for each algorithm to calibrate the models. Then we used a weighted averaging based on TSS statistics and Area Under Curve (AUC) to evaluate them. To create a single model for each species and climate scenario we used only the models that present AUC and TSS values greater than the average of all algorithms. After that, we created ensemble models with “weighted averages” through  the TSS value (Ribeiro-Souza et al., 2022) using the R package sdm (Naimi and Araújo, 2016). This method provides a consensus distribution area and defines areas with high uncertainty (Araújo and New, 2007). Lastly, we transformed the final continuous models into binary (presence = 1 and absence = 0) using the threshold that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity (Max SSS) (Liu et al., 2013)."
